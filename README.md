# STRAP
Single-molecule TRacking And Processing pipeline.
This pipeline was developed to streamline single-molecule imaging analysis using Fiji, Python, and MATLAB. It integrates legacy code and newly written modules, and was designed to automate large portions of the processing and analysis workflow.
The latest version of the software can be found at 'https://github.com/codedbynayem/STRAP'.
